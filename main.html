	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the measurement of the total number of operations an algorithm performs as the input size grows. ideally if the time taken is less, than it is considered as efficient code.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the total amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute, also in relation to the input size. if there is n number of inputs it can be represented as O(n)</p>
